This repository contains the settings files that I use for Notion, the a 
tiling, tabbed window manager for X.

Notion is released under the LGPL v2.1 with additional restrictions relating
to the name. All settings here that are my own work are likewise released under
the LGPL v2.1.

Notion can be found at:
